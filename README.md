## Important info
Yesterday I got a **starter Arduino Kit** with a lot of projects in it. In this repo I'll upload every completed project including the code I used, if there's one. 
You can buy it in the _Arduino Official Store_: https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-starter-kit-multi-language

## Simple ones
Before we start, there you have some simple circuits with leds, buttons, potentiometers and more stuff. In these you **DON'T** need code, it's all made in the board.
Soon I'll be posting **all** the projects the book proposes you to complete.
