## Important info
Finally, I got a **starter Arduino Kit** with a lot of projects in it. In this repo I'll upload every completed project including the code I used, if there's one. 
You can buy it in the _Arduino Official Store_: https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-starter-kit-multi-language

## Contact
If you want to contact me, please use my email: contact.antooonio12@gmail.com. There you can suggest me anything you want.
My goal is to learn a lot, so I'll apreciate it.
